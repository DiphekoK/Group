# E-Commerce Database Design 📦💻

## 🎯 Objective
This project focuses on mastering database design principles and collaborative development. Our goal is to design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and create an e-commerce database from scratch to manage products, their variations, and attributes effectively.

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview
- **ERD Creation**: Define entities (tables), attributes, and relationships between tables.
- **Database Structure**: Implement tables with appropriate constraints, including primary and foreign keys.
- **Team Collaboration**: Work together on analysis, design, and implementation to ensure a cohesive project.
- **Submission**: Make a public GitHub repository containing the final ERD and `ecommerce.sql` file.

## 🗃️ Database Tables
The database includes the following tables:
1. **product_image**: Stores URLs or file references for product images.
2. **color**: Manages available color options.
3. **product_category**: Groups products into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics).
4. **product**: Contains general product details (name, brand, base price).
5. **product_item**: Represents purchasable items with specific variations.
6. **brand**: Stores brand-related data.
7. **product_variation**: Links a product to its variations (e.g., size, color).
8. **size_category**: Groups sizes into categories (e.g., clothing sizes, shoe sizes).
9. **size_option**: Lists specific sizes (e.g., S, M, L, 42).
10. **product_attribute**: Stores custom attributes (e.g., material, weight).
11. **attribute_category**: Groups attributes into categories (e.g., physical, technical).
12. **attribute_type**: Defines types of attributes (e.g., text, number, boolean).
